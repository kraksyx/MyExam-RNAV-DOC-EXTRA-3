    "question": "Which of the following statements about the accuracy that can be obtained with DGPS of satellite navigation systems is correct?",
    "options": [
      "A DGPS receiver can detect and correct for multi-path error, providing a more accurate position.",
      "Only DGPS allows position fixes accurate enough for non-precision approaches",
      "The increase in accuracy of position fixes is independent of the receiver position in relation to the ground station.",
